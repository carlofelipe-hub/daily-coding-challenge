""# üéØ Day 3 Challenge ‚Äî FizzBuzz

Welcome to **Day 3** of the Daily Coding Challenge! Today, we're tackling a classic problem called **FizzBuzz**. This is often used as a basic coding interview question, and it‚Äôs perfect for mastering:

- Loops (`for`)
- Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Modulus Operator (`%`)

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python** and **VSCode** set up from previous days.  
If not, follow the setup guide [here](../day-01/README.md).

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to the Challenge

Move to the Day 3 challenge folder:

```bash
cd challenges/day-03
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Open in VSCode

To open the folder in VSCode:

```bash
code .
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Write Your Code

In `example.py`, you will be writing a script that:

1. Loops from **1 to 100**.
2. For each number:
   - If the number is divisible by **3**, print `"Fizz"`.
   - If the number is divisible by **5**, print `"Buzz"`.
   - If the number is divisible by **both 3 and 5**, print `"FizzBuzz"`.
   - Otherwise, just print the number.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run Your Code

To test your code, run:

```bash
python3 example.py
```

---

## ‚úÖ Example Output

```
