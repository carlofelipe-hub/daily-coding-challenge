""# 🎯 Day 2 Challenge — Simple Calculator

Welcome to **Day 2** of the Daily Coding Challenge! Today, we are building a **Simple Calculator** in Python. You'll learn about:

- Arithmetic Operations
- User Input
- Conditional Logic
- Error Handling

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python** and **VSCode** set up from Day 1.  
If not, follow the setup guide [here](../day-01/README.md).

---

### 2️⃣ Navigate to the Challenge

Move to the Day 2 challenge folder:

```bash
cd challenges/day-02
```

---

### 3️⃣ Open in VSCode

To open the folder in VSCode:

```bash
code .
```

---

### 4️⃣ Write Your Code

In `example.py`, you will be writing a script that:

1. Accepts two numbers from the user.
2. Accepts an arithmetic operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
3. Performs the calculation and displays the result.

---

### 5️⃣ Run Your Code

To test your code, run:

```bash
python3 example.py
```

---

## 📌 Bonus Task

Handle edge cases:

- If the user tries to divide by zero, print `"Cannot divide by zero."`.
- If the inputs are not numbers, print `"Invalid Input"`.

---

## ✅ Example Output

```
Enter first number: 10
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): *
Enter second number: 5
Result: 50
```

```
Enter first number: 5
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): /
Enter second number: 0
Cannot divide by zero.
```

```
Enter first number: abc
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): +
Enter second number: 5
Invalid Input
```
