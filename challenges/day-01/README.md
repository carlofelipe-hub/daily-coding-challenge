""# üéØ Day 1 Challenge ‚Äî Age Checker

Welcome to **Day 1** of the Daily Coding Challenge! Today, we're going to build a simple **Age Checker** in Python to get you familiar with:

- Basic Input and Output
- Conditionals (if, elif, else)
- Simple error handling

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Python

First, make sure you have **Python** installed on your machine.

- [Download Python here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Follow the installation instructions for your OS (Windows/Mac/Linux).

To confirm it's installed, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 --version
```

You should see something like: `Python 3.x.x`

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

We'll be using **VSCode** for coding.

- [Download VSCode here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Install the **Python extension** for better coding experience.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/daily-coding-challenge.git
cd daily-coding-challenge
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to the Challenge

Go to the Day 1 challenge folder:

```bash
cd challenges/day-01
```

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Open in VSCode

To open the folder in VSCode:

```bash
code .
```

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Write Your Code

In `example.py`, you will be writing a script that:

1. Accepts a user's age as input.
2. Prints:
   - `"Minor"` if age is less than 18.
   - `"Adult"` if age is between 18 and 60.
   - `"Senior Citizen"` if age is 60 or above.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Run Your Code

To test your code, run:

```bash
python3 example.py
```

---

## üìå Bonus Task

Handle edge cases:

- If the age is negative, print `"Invalid Age"`.
- If the input is not a number, print `"Invalid Input"`.

---

## ‚úÖ Example Output

```
Enter your age: 25
You are an Adult.
```

```
Enter your age: -5
Invalid Age
```

```
Enter your age: abc
Invalid Input
```
