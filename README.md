# 🏆 Daily Coding Challenge (Puqo Edition)

Welcome to the **Puqo Daily Coding Challenge**! This repo is specially made for us to sharpen our coding skills, one day at a time. We'll be grinding through the basics of **Python** and moving up to **JavaScript** web development. Made with love for the **Puqo Discord Server**. 💙

## 🚀 How It Works

Every single day, there’s a new coding challenge waiting for you. These are designed to:

1. Build your foundational skills.
2. Slowly introduce more complexity.
3. Make you a coding beast over time.

And syempre, walang iwanan, we help each other out! 🙌
